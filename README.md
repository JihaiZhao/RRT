# Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree
A Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a fundamental path planning algorithm in robotics. Path planning is the task of moving a robot from one location to another, while avoiding obstacles and satisfying constraints.

An RRT consists of a set of vertices, which represent configurations in some domain D
 and edges, which connect two vertices. The algorithm randomly builds a tree in such a way that, as the number of vertices n
 increases to ∞
, the vertices are uniformly distributed across the domain D⊂Rn
.

## Task 1: Simple RRT

## Task 2: Planning a Path with Obstacles

## Task 3: RRT with Arbitrary Objects
